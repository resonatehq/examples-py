Webhooks & notificationsEvent-driven processingConsume Kafka messages exactly-once, no need to worry about timeouts or offsets.See an example


@DBOS.kafka_consumer(config,["alerts-topic"])@DBOS.workflow()def process_kafka_alerts(msg: KafkaMessage):  alerts = msg.value.decode()  for alert in alerts:    respond_to_alert(alert)Create reliable workflowsWrite your business logic in normal code, with branches, loops, subtasks, and retries. DBOS makes it resilient to any failure.See an example


@DBOS.workflow()def checkout_workflow(items):    order = create_order()    reserve_inventory(order, items)    payment_status = process_payment(order, items)    if payment_status == 'paid':        fulfill_order(order)    else:        undo_reserve_inventory(order, items)        cancel_order(order)Cron jobs made easySchedule workflows to run at specific times.Host them completely serverlessly.See an example


@DBOS.scheduled("0 * * * *") # Run once an hour@DBOS.workflow()def run_hourly(scheduled_time: datetime, actual_time: datetime):   results = search_hackernews("serverless")   for comment, url in results:      post_to_slack(comment, url)Resilient data pipelinesBuild data pipelines that are reliable and observable by default.DBOS durable queues guarantee all your tasks complete.See an example


queue = Queue("indexing_queue")@DBOS.workflow()def indexing_workflow(urls: List[HttpUrl]):  handles: List[WorkflowHandle] = []  for url in urls:    	handle = queue.enqueue(index_document, url)    	handles.append(handle)	indexed_pages = 0 for handle in handles:    		indexed_pages += handle.get_result()	logger.info(f"Indexed {len(urls)} documents totaling {indexed_pages} pages")Reliable AI agentsEnhance your AI workflows with DBOS, build reliable AI agents with automatic retries and no limit on how long they can run for.See an example


@DBOS.step(retries_allowed=True, max_attempts=2)def process_refund(item, reason):    return f"Processed refund for item {item}, because {reason}"@DBOS.step(retries_allowed=True, max_attempts=3)def apply_discount(amount):    return f"Applied discount of {amount}%"refunds_agent = Agent(    name="Refunds Agent",    instructions="Help the user with a refund. If the reason is that it was too expensive, offer the user a refund code.",    functions=[process_refund, apply_discount],)Webhooks & notificationsEffortlessly mix synchronous webhook code with asynchronous event processing. Reliably wait weeks or months for events, then use idempotency and durable execution to process them exactly once.See an example


@slackapp.message()def handle_message(request: BoltRequest) -> None:  event_id = request.body["event_id"]  with SetWorkflowID(event_id):    DBOS.start_workflow(message_workflow,     request.body["event"])2024 Gartner® Cool Vendor™Enabling Efficient Cloud OperationsBrands building 10x fasterBrands building 10x fasterBrands building 10x fasterReliable backends built in minutes, not months.Reliable backends built in minutes, not months.Build 10x fasterJust code your business logic – that’s it.DBOS makes your apps reliable and observable by default.Compatible with: Python Typescript Postgres AWS Node.js KafkaOnly pay while code executesServerless architecture means you don’t pay for idled CPU time.So while DBOS is doing more, you’re paying less.Deploy with a single clickServerlessly deploy your application with a single command.Automatically scale to millions of users.Start your projectNo credit card required.Easy to launch.
